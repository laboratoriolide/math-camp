# Instructions

This exam lasts one hour and a half (90 minutes). Please answer in the Google form [here](https://forms.gle/Uss12DX46oJgFVSNA). It is mandatory to keep your camera on during the entire exam. You are not allowed to use any external resources.

# Questions

1\. A new statistical software has been developed. The following operation was performed in the console:

$$2+5+6\div 3\times 2$$ 

The answer to the operation provided by the software was **8.67**. What order of operations seems to be used by the software?

a. PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

b. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.

c. Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.

d. None of the above. 

2\. A study involved implementing different treatments to different towns around a certain province in country. The treatment involved the use of political awareness campaigns to see if the number of people voting in the next election increased. 50% of people registered to vote was randomly selected to receive the treatment. Within the treatment group, 60% of people lived in urban areas. How much of those registered to vote received the treatment and lived in urban areas?

a. 30%

b. 20%

c. 12%

d. None of the above

a. True

b. False

c. Cannot be determined

d. None of the above

7\. The population variance formula is given by:

$$ \sigma^2 = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2$$

a. $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \dfrac{1}{n-1} (x_i - \bar{x})^2$

A political scientist has theorized that the popularity function of a candidate will be given determined in a complex model, where popularity is a function of the number of votes obtained in the previous election, the number of years in office, and the number of scandals in which the candidate has been involved. A reduced form estimation would potentially involve:

a. Estimating the popularity function directly, using a simplified model.
b. Carefully determining the relationships between the variables in separate models, taking the theoretical model seriously. 
c. No estimation at all, as the model is too complex to be estimated.
d. None of the above.
