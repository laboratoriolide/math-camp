# What is a quantitative model?

- A model represents a simplified version of reality.
    - It is a tool to understand and predict the behavior of a system.
    - It is a way to test hypotheses and theories.

- We focus on simplified realities because sometimes we don't care about all the details.
    - Details are irrelevant to the question we are asking.
    - It is easier to first understand the simple situation, then extend.

- A quantitative model is a model that uses quantitative information (numbers, equations, etc) to represent the real-world system.
    - We can later use this model to make predictions and test hypotheses.
    - Data can be used to validate or invalidate the model.
    - Public policy decisions can be made based on the model.

# Social science models

- Social scientists use models to understand how humans interact with their reality.

- In this lecture we focus on the common language of social science models
    - "Parameters", "Variables", "Constants"
    - "Exogenous"/"Endogenous"
    - "Equilibrium", "Stability", "Dynamics"
    - "Independent"/"Dependent" - "Explanatory"/"Explained"
    - "Functions", "Functional form", "Equations", "Assumptions"
