# Why matrices?

- Matrices are a way to organize data in a structured way.

- When dealing with complex mathematical models or operations, using "normal" algebra can be cumbersome.

- For instance, consider a four-variable system of equations:

\begin{align*}
2x + 3y + 4z + 5w &= 10 \\
3x + 4y + 5z + 6w &= 20 \\
4x + 5y + 6z + 7w &= 30 \\
5x + 6y + 7z + 8w &= 40
\end{align*}

# Why matrices?

- If we try to solve this system using algebra, we would have to do a lot of calculations.

- For instance, we may try to solve the first equation for $x$:

\begin{align*}
2x &= 10 - 3y - 4z - 5w \\
x &= \frac{10 - 3y - 4z - 5w}{2}
\end{align*}

- And then substitute this expression into the second equation:

\begin{align*}
3\left(\frac{10 - 3y - 4z - 5w}{2}\right) + 4y + 5z + 6w &= 20
\end{align*}

# Why matrices?

- Which would then need to be simplified and solved for $y$:

\begin{align*}
\frac{30 - 9y - 12z - 15w}{2} + 4y + 5z + 6w &= 20
\end{align*}

- And so on...

# Why matrices?

- **Matrices** are rectangular arrays of numbers considered as a single mathematical entity.

- They can help organize a system of equations or complex mathematical operations in a more structured way.

- Through matrix algebra, we can perform operations on matrices quickly and efficiently.

# Matrix notation

- We represent a matrix with a capital letter, usually in boldface, e.g., $\mathbf{A}$.
    - In handwritten text, matrices are often represented with capital letters in block letters, e.g., $\mathbb{A}$, or using a different color. 

- Consider, for instance, the following matrix:
\begin{equation*}
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

- We usually either use square brackets or round brackets (parentheses) to represent matrices.

# Elements

- The numbers in the matrix are called **elements**. They are usually represented with lowercase letters, e.g., $a_{ij}$.

- We typically define the *dimension* of a matrix as the number of rows and columns it has. Thus, the matrix $A$ above is a $3 \times 4$ matrix.

- To refer to a specific element in a matrix, we use the notation $a_{ij}$, where $i$ is the row number and $j$ is the column number. 
    - For instance, in the matrix $A$ above, $a_{23} = 7$.

# Matrix general form

- A matrix can be represented in general form as follows:

\begin{equation*}
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

- Where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns.

- This matrix is said to be an $m \times n$ matrix.\

- It is common to see the dimensions of the matrix written as a subscript, e.g., $A_{m \times n}$. or $\underset{\scriptscriptstyle m\times n}{A}$

# Vectors

- A vector is a special case of a matrix that has only one column or one row.

- Vectors which have only one column are called **column vectors**.

- Vectors which have only one row are called **row vectors**.

- For instance, consider the following column vector:

\begin{equation*}
v =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
2 \\
3 \\
4
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

# The main diagonal

- The **main diagonal** of a matrix is the set of elements that run from the top left to the bottom right of the matrix.

- More formally, the main diagonal of a matrix $A$ is the set of elements $a_{ij}$ where $i = j$.

- For instance, consider the following matrix:

\begin{equation*}
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

- The main diagonal of this matrix is $\{1, 5, 9\}$.

- Sometimes we refer to the main diagonal as only the "diagonal" of the matrix.


# Special matrices

- There are several types of special matrices that are commonly used, and you should be familiar with them.

- **Square matrix**: A matrix where the number of rows is equal to the number of columns.

\begin{equation*}
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
\text{is a square matrix.}
\end{equation*}

# Special matrices

- **Diagonal matrix**: A square matrix where all elements off the main diagonal are equal to 0.

\begin{equation*}
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
\text{is a diagonal matrix.}
\end{equation*}

- **Note**: Sometimes, everything that is not in the main diagonal is referred to as the "off-diagonals".

# Special matrices

- **Identity matrix**: A square matrix where all elements on the main diagonal are equal to 1 and all other elements are equal to 0.

- This matrix is usually represented by the symbol $I_n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the matrix.
    - For instance, $I_3$ is a $3 \times 3$ identity matrix, as it always a square matrix.

- The identity matrix is analogous to the number 1 in normal algebra.

\begin{equation*}
I_3 =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

# Special matrices

- **Zero matrix**: A matrix where all elements are equal to 0.

- This matrix is usually represented by the symbol $O_{m \times n}$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns.
