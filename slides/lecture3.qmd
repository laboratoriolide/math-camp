# Equation systems

- A set of of equations that share the same variables is called an *equation system*.

- For example:

\begin{align}
x + y &= 3 \\
2x - y &= 1
\end{align}

- Because both (1) and (2) share $x$ and $y$, they form an equation system.

- We usually want to *solve* the system, i.e., find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both equations.

# Solving equation systems

- There are several methods to solve equation systems.
    - Substitution
    - Elimination
    - Graphing
    - Matrices (we will see this later)

- Substitution is typically the most "mechanical" method.
    - Express one variable in terms of the other and substitute in the other equation.

- Elimination is more algebraic.
    - Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.
    - Might involve multiplying one or both equations by a constant.

# Solving the example system

- Let's solve the example system:

\begin{align*}
x + y &= 3 \\
2x - y &= 1
\end{align*}

- We can solve this system by substitution.
    - From (1), we have $y = 3 - x$.
    - Substitute this into (2):

$$2x - (3 - x) = 1$$

- Solve for $x$ and then substitute back to find $y$.

# The Cartesian plane

- The Cartesian plane is a two-dimensional space where we can plot points.

- It is formed by two perpendicular lines, the *x-axis* and the *y-axis*.

- The point where the axes intersect is called the *origin*.

- The axes divide the plane into four *quadrants*.

# The Cartesian plane

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        axis lines=middle,
        xlabel=$x$,
        ylabel=$y$,
        xmin=-5,
        xmax=5,
        ymin=-5,
        ymax=5,
        xtick={-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4},
        ytick={-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4},
        xticklabels={$-4$,$-3$,$-2$,$-1$,$1$,$2$,$3$,$4$},
        yticklabels={$-4$,$-3$,$-2$,$-1$,$1$,$2$,$3$,$4$},
        ticklabel style={font=\tiny},
        enlargelimits=true,
        clip=false
    ]
    \node at (axis cs: -4.5, 4.5) {II};
    \node at (axis cs: -4.5, -4.5) {IV};
    \node at (axis cs: 4.5, -4.5) {III};
    \node at (axis cs: 4.5, 4.5) {I};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

# Plotting points

- To plot a point, we use an ordered pair $(x, y)$.
    - $x$ is the distance from the $y$-axis.
    - $y$ is the distance from the $x$-axis.

- For example, the point $(2, 3)$ is 2 units to the right and 3 units up from the origin. See below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        axis lines=middle,
        xlabel=$x$,
        ylabel=$y$,
        xmin=-5,
        xmax=5,
        ymin=-5,
        ymax=5,
        xtick={-4,-2, 2, 4},
        ytick={-4,-2,2,4},
        xticklabels={$-4$,$-2$,$2$,$4$},
        yticklabels={$-4$,$-2$,$2$,$4$},
        ticklabel style={font=\tiny},
        enlargelimits=true,
        clip=false,
        width = 5cm,
        height = 5cm
    ]
    \addplot[only marks] coordinates {(2, 3)};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

# Linear equations

- The equations we've seen so far are *linear* equations.
    - They represent straight lines in the Cartesian plane.

- Linear equations can be written in the form $y = mx + b$.
    - $m$ is the *slope* of the line.
    - $b$ is the *y-intercept*.

# The Slope

- The ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change.
    - It tells us how steep the line is.
    - The bigger the slope, the steeper the line.

- Given by $m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

- Requires two points (call them $P_1$ and $P_2$) on the line, with coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.
