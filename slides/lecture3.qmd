# Equation systems

- A set of of equations that share the same variables is called an *equation system*.

- For example:

\begin{align}
x + y &= 3 \\
2x - y &= 1
\end{align}

- Because both (1) and (2) share $x$ and $y$, they form an equation system.

- We usually want to *solve* the system, i.e., find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both equations.

# Solving equation systems

- There are several methods to solve equation systems.
    - Substitution
    - Elimination
    - Graphing
    - Matrices (we will see this later)

- Substitution is typically the most "mechanical" method.
    - Express one variable in terms of the other and substitute in the other equation.

- Elimination is more algebraic.
    - Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.
    - Might involve multiplying one or both equations by a constant.

# Solving the example system

- Let's solve the example system:

\begin{align*}
x + y &= 3 \\
2x - y &= 1
\end{align*}

- We can solve this system by substitution.
    - From (1), we have $y = 3 - x$.
    - Substitute this into (2):

$$2x - (3 - x) = 1$$

- Solve for $x$ and then substitute back to find $y$.

# The Cartesian plane

- The Cartesian plane is a two-dimensional space where we can plot points.

- It is formed by two perpendicular lines, the *x-axis* and the *y-axis*.

- The point where the axes intersect is called the *origin*.

- The axes divide the plane into four *quadrants*.

    \node at (axis cs: 4.5, 4.5) {I};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

# Plotting points

- To plot a point, we use an ordered pair $(x, y)$.
    - $x$ is the distance from the $y$-axis.
    - $y$ is the distance from the $x$-axis.

- For example, the point $(2, 3)$ is 2 units to the right and 3 units up from the origin. See below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        axis lines=middle,
        xlabel=$x$,
        ylabel=$y$,
        xmin=-5,
        xmax=5,
        ymin=-5,
        ymax=5,
        xtick={-4,-2, 2, 4},
        ytick={-4,-2,2,4},
        xticklabels={$-4$,$-2$,$2$,$4$},
        yticklabels={$-4$,$-2$,$2$,$4$},
        ticklabel style={font=\tiny},
        enlargelimits=true,
        clip=false,
        width = 5cm,
        height = 5cm
    ]
    \addplot[only marks] coordinates {(2, 3)};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

# Linear equations

- The equations we've seen so far are *linear* equations.
    - They represent straight lines in the Cartesian plane.

- Linear equations can be written in the form $y = mx + b$.
    - $m$ is the *slope* of the line.
    - $b$ is the *y-intercept*.

# The Slope

- The ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change.
    - It tells us how steep the line is.
    - The bigger the slope, the steeper the line.

- Given by $m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

- Requires two points (call them $P_1$ and $P_2$) on the line, with coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.

# Intercepts

- The *y-intercept* is the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis.
    - This happens when $x = 0$.
    - So, we set $x = 0$ in the equation and solve for $y$.
    - In the equation $y = mx + b$, the $y$-intercept is $(0, b)$.

- The *x-intercept* is the point where the line crosses the $x$-axis.
    - This happens when $y = 0$.
    - So, we set $y = 0$ in the equation and solve for $x$.

# Graphing linear equations

- To graph a linear equation, we need to find two points on the line.
    - The easiest points are the intercepts.
    - We can also use the slope to find a second point.

- Example: graph the line $y = 2x + 1$.
    - It might be useful to draw a table of values.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
$x$ & $y$ \\
\hline
0 & 1 \\
1 & 3 \\
-1 & -1
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\end{figure}

# Upward-sloping and downward-sloping lines

- If $m > 0$, the line is "upward-sloping" or increasing.
    - As $x$ increases, $y$ also increases.

- If $m < 0$, the line is "downward-sloping" or decreasing.
    - As $x$ increases, $y$ decreases.

    axis lines = middle,

    ylabel = $y$,

    color=red
]

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

# Properties of slopes

- If $m = 0$, the line is horizontal.
    - $y$ does not change as $x$ changes.

- If $m = \infty$, the line is vertical.
    - $x$ does not change as $y$ changes.

- If $m = 1$, the line has a 45-degree angle.

- Lines with the same slope are parallel.

- Lines with slopes that multiply to -1 are perpendicular.
    - This means that $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$, or that $m_1 = -\dfrac{1}{m_2}$ (the negative reciprocal).

# How to find the equation of a line

1. If you know the slope $m$ and a point $(x_1, y_1)$ on the line, you can use the point-slope form:
    - $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

2. If you know two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ on the line, you can use the slope formula to find $m$ and then use $y = mx + b$ to find $b$.

3. If you know the slope $m$ and the $y$-intercept $b$, you can use $y = mx + b$ directly (this is the slope-intercept or point-slope form).

# Graphing equation systems

- To solve an equation system graphically, we graph both equations and find the point where they intersect.

- The point of intersection is the solution to the system.

- Example: graph the system

\begin{align*}
x + y &= 3 \\
2x - y &= 1
\end{align*}

# Systems with no solutions

- Sometimes, the lines are parallel and do not intersect.
    - This means that the system has no solution.

- How can we tell if two lines are parallel?
    - They have the same slope.
    - The coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the equations are proportional.

# Systems with infinite solutions

- Sometimes, the lines coincide and intersect at every point.
    - This means that the system has infinite solutions.

- How can we tell if two lines coincide?
    - They have the same slope and the same $y$-intercept.
    - The coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the equations are proportional, and the constants are equal.
